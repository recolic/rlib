# Warning: This IS NOT single-file rlib header

This directory contains useful standalone headers, for various c/cpp debugging.

They **are not** part of rlib, and they are intended for situations while not practical to include a complete rlib.

> DO NOT expect too much for these low-quality toys.

|Header|Note|
|------|----|
|rdebug.h|Minimal C helper to print debug output|
|c-with-class.h|Old fashioned trick used in some C homeworks|
|rlib.min.hpp|Minimal io/string helper for solving OJ questions, or writing POC program|
